# SoundexRevision
A revision of the traditional Soundex formula in VB, optimized for auditing applications.

This repository contains a .bas file which outlines the traditionla simimlarity() function, as well as a rollingsim() function
that makes up the bulk of my contribution. The HTML file contains a verbose description of the motivation and differences,
as well as a demonstration of results from both the traditional and rolling method.
